   abstract = {The growing concern about nuclear terrorism threats has enhanced the need to develop fast and accurate nuclear forensics analysis techniques for nuclear material source attribution and to create a credible nuclear deterrence. Plutonium produced as a by-product in nuclear reactor fuel, especially in fuel discharged at low burn-up (1 to 2 MWd/kg), is potentially weapons usable material. In the event of plutonium interdiction from a smuggling act, its origin has to be established through nuclear forensics attribution methods before any response is initiated against this malicious act. The characteristics of separated plutonium from discharged reactor fuel and the associated fission product traces depend on factors such as the reactor type (thermal or fast reactor), fuel burn-up, irradiation history, and the chemical process used to separate plutonium. A new methodology of using trace fission product to plutonium ratios for nuclear forensics attribution of plutonium to the type of reactor used for its production is presented along with results obtained for case studies of a fast neutron spectrum breeder reactor and a thermal neutron spectrum reactor using open literature design information of these two types of nuclear reactors.

   abstract = {Cerium- and 144 promethium-147, accompanied by rare earths resulting from fission or decay can be removed from Purex 1WW in>90% yield as an insoluble, crystalline sodium-rare earth double sulfate. Precipitation is initiated by a one-to-three hour equilibration at 90 deg C and centrifugation at 90 deg C to take advantage of the lower solubility of the double sulfate salt at a higher temperature. The sulfate concentration should be one molar and the solution pH at the time of precipitation should be 0.5 to 1.5. The addition of tartrate ion to complex the iron allows the use of a higher pH and sulfate concentration, gives a more complete separation from iron, and a quantitative recovery of the rare earths. The double sulfate precipitate can be dissolved in dilute nitric acid or converted to the carbonate and then dissolved to yield a solution for further processing. The double sulfate precipitation of the rare earths, with tartrate added, gives a good separation from impurities. One-cycle decontamination factors of 150 for Zr-Nb and 1100 for Ru-Rh have been achieved in laboratory tests. Tests in the Purex head-end equipment with up to twomegacurie batches of cerium have corroborated the laboratory results. Decontamination factors of 70 for iron, 10 for zirconium, 20 for niobium and 25 for ruthenium have been obtained. It was found wise to limit the batch size because decay heat leads to partial calcination in the centrifuge and to difficulty in redissolution. (auth)

   abstract = {Increasing industrial, military, and space requirements for certain fission products place emphasis on large-scale methods for their recovery from waste liquors produced by the fuel recovery processes. With development of organic extractants for separating and recovering these fission products, solvent extraction offers a versatile alternative to ion-exchange, precipitation, and crystallization procedures heretofore used for small-scale recoveries. A process flowsheet was developed for the recovery of strontium and mixed rare earths from adjusted Purex 1WW solution by the use of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA). After adding tartrate t complex the iron and caustic to adjust the pH to 6, strontium and rare earths are co-extracted and then co-stripped with nitric acid in the first cycle. In additional D2EHPA extraction cycles, they are isolated as concentrated fractions. The mixed rare earths from this process can be treated by tributyl phosphate (TBP) extraction to separate the individual rare earth elements of which promethium and cerium are of greatest interest. Zirconium--niobium also may be recovered with D2EHPA from acidic waste liquors. An amine pretreatment extraction process was developed for removing nitric acid, iron sulfate, zirconium-- niobium, and ruthenium from waste solutions to furnish a feed liquor more amenable to subsequent processes for recovering fission products. The separate recovery of ruthenium, zirconium-- niobium, and rare earths may also be possible by amine extraction. A process based on the use of substituted phenols was developed for recovering cesium from alkaline waste solutions. These compounds are selective extractants for cesium, giving high decontamination from other fission products and sodium, and they are readily stripped with dilute nitric acid. Previous studies also outlined methods for recovering neptunium, plutonium, and technetium with solvents similar to those described. When appropriately cornbined, these developments offer a versatile integrated solvent extraction flowsheet for the recovery of all important fission products and other components from waste liquors.
